## Task
We want to convert an image, like a  **.jpg** file to a text file with triple comma-separated values of RGB, where these triples are separated by one space. For example:  
```
0,0,200 0,0,10 10,0,0
90,90,50 90,90,10 255,255,255
100,100,88 80,80,80 15,75,255 
```
The above is an image represented by 3x3 pixels. For each pixel the Blue, Green and Red values are provided, separated by commas. The top left pixel has (Blue=0,Green=0,Red=200). The top-right pixel has (Blue=10,Green=0,Red=0). The bottom-right pixel has (Blue=15,Green=75,Red=255). The bottom-left pixel has (Blue=100,Green=100, Red=88).
